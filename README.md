# 🎧 Audiophile E-Commerce Platform

**Audiophile** is a full-stack e-commerce website for purchasing high-quality audio products such as headphones, speakers, and earphones.  
It delivers a smooth shopping experience with a clean interface, dynamic cart functionality, and a connected backend built with Node.js and PostgreSQL.

This project was developed as part of my **CodeAlpha Internship**, showcasing practical skills in building functional web applications from both the frontend and backend perspectives.
